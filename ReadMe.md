## About this repo

This repo is made to encompass the installation process of the **Raspberry Pi** (Rpi).\
Several projects I will be working on, will use the Rpi board so for the sake of convenience the installation processes and initial setups wil be described here and this repo referenced on the projects where needed.

# Installing the OS to the SD card
Get the OS (Operating System) image you want to install from the official website: [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/). \
Keep in mind the hardware limitations of the Pi you are using when choosing the system. Being too greedy will only lead to a frustrating experience. Also the SD card should be a verified one as some instances of the pi not booting are due to incompatible SD cards.\
To write the chosen OS to the SD card use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/). You could skip the first step as the Pi Imager allows you to download the OS directly during the installation, but that makes the process **MUCH** longer.\
As a personal preference I usually format the SD cards to EXFAT not FAT32.\

***Pi Imager default screen*** \
![default_screen](img/Screenshot%202021-03-21%20090302.png)\
Select "CHOOSE OS" option first to add the OS to install.

***Operating System selection pop out window***\
![install_OS](img/Screenshot%202021-03-21%20100713.png)\
To install the downloaded image scroll to the very bottom and select "Use custom".\
(In this example I'm installing ***Ubuntu 20.10 Server***.)

***SD Card selection pop out window***\
![SD_Card](img/Screenshot%202021-03-21%20155439.png)\
Here a 323Gb card is detected.

***Writing the OS to the card***\
![Writing](img/Screenshot%202021-03-23%20195510.png)\
This process takes around 10mn depending on your system RAM.

***All set***\
